# Vuex vs Pinia
## A pratical comparasion between Pinia and Vuex
_This is my first-ever blog, inspired by my brother, Thuc Phan. Thuc is not just my cousin; he's a skillful software architect with a profound love for technology. He is so famous in my family that my father specifically asked him to be my tech mentor. However, I must admit, I was a rather lazy student, and Thuc often humorously referred to me as someone who hadn't quite reached the end of the tree of knowledge. VueX vs Pinia is one of the topics that i didn't fully understand at that time. So im writing this blog to provide you guys an easy to understand comparasion._

### What is state management
State management is the organized handling of data representing the current state of a web application. It becomes crucial as applications grow in complexity, helping manage shared data between components, handle user input, and manage asynchronous operations.

An easier state management explaination is keeping track of toys. Imagine you have different toy boxes for different games, you need to know where each toy is. State management keep your toys organized and find toys easier whenever we want to play.
